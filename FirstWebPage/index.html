    <p><strong>Pool bear</strong> From Wikipedia</p>
    <p>
      The free
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">encyclopedia</a> The
      polar bear <em> (Ursus maritimus)</em> is a carnivorous bear whose native
      range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic
      Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large
      bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus
      arctos middendorffi).[3]

      A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb),[4] while a
      sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister
      species of the brown bear,[5] it has evolved to occupy a narrower
      ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold
      temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting
      seals, which make up most of its diet.[6] Although most polar bears are
      born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their
      scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar
      bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often
      living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their
      dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine
      mammals.[7]

      Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear
      is classified as a vulnerable species, and at least three of the nineteen
      polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline.[8] However, at least
      two of the nineteen subpopulations are currently increasing, while another
      six are considered stable.[9] For decades, large-scale hunting raised
      international concern for the future of the species, but populations
      rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.[10] For
      thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material,
      spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears
      remain important in their cultures. Historically, the polar bear has also
      been known as the white bear.[11] Naming and etymology Constantine John
      Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in
      1774.[1]
